Here's a collection of skins I made for personal use. I decided to release them since T0Y released his ELS Bearcat. 
These skins are lore friendly and are 2K. There's 1 skin per vehicle except for the SAHP. There are 3 SAHP skins,
two black, one white. That way theres a 1 in 3 chance of a white SAHP Bearcat.
This file includes blue light textures if you want to convert the lights to all blue. 
Ive also included the light textures (Credit to T0y)
I've included 2 VCF Files: 
	redandblue.xml -	Edited t0y's original to add blue environmental lights.
	allblue.xml -		All environmental lighs are blue / amber. No red.

Feel free to modify these skins as you want. If you have any request, let me know and I'll see about getting it done.
